    ///  configuration steps, so that they can be shipped to a remote app domain and run there.

    ///  Note that these configurers should ideally always be public, so that they can be reused as best as possible by repros, etc.
    ///  Also, best practice is to log out the task which the configurer is doing, with the [Configuration] prefix so that its easy 
    ///  to see from test logs what was done to the target object.
    /// 
    ///  TestSettings should never be modified from inside of configure calls.

    /// All Configurers should be marked as // [Serializable], so that they can be serialized and sent to additional app domains, etc.
