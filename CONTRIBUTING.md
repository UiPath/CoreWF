## Ways to contribute
While features and fixes are greatly appreciated, there are other ways to contribute to this project. If you find a bug, create a test that reveals the bug. If you find a performance issue, create an issue with a PerfView profile, memory dump, or even a [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/) benchmark.

## Developing with .NET Core SDK
CoreWF requires .NET Core SDK 3.1 or higher. Download and install from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

From the command prompt, navigate to the **src** folder. To build, run the command:
```
dotnet build
```

To test, run the command:
```
dotnet test
```

## Developing with Visual Studio 2019
Any edition of Visual Studio 2019 will work for developing CoreWF. The community edition is available free from [here](). Make sure that the **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload is selected. This should add the .NET Core 3.1 SDK component.

Open the **System.Activities.sln** file under the **src** folder. The Test Explorer will locate all the tests in the solution automatically.
